# ðŸ“– Python Dictionary with Word Suggestion

This is a simple Python dictionary app that lets you look up the meaning of words from a pre-loaded JSON dataset. It also suggests the closest matching word if the entered word is not found.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Search for word meanings using a JSON file as the dictionary database.
- Intelligent word suggestions using Python's `difflib.get_close_matches`.
- Handles user confirmation for suggestions.
- Clean and simple command-line interface.

## ðŸ§  How It Works

- The script loads a JSON file containing a dictionary (`data.json`).
- It accepts a word input from the user.
- If the word exists in the dictionary, it returns the meaning.
- If the word doesn't exist, it uses fuzzy matching to suggest a close word.
- The user can confirm if the suggestion is correct.
- If confirmed, the meaning of the closest match is returned.

## ðŸ“„ Requirements
Python 3.x

No external libraries needed except the standard library modules:

json

difflib

## ðŸ›  Setup & Run
 Clone the repository or download the code files.
 Make sure your data.json file is in the correct path.

Run the script:
 Py_dictionary.py


 # ðŸ’¡ Notes
Ensure the data.json path is correctly set in the code:

You may want to change it to a relative path for portability:
data = json.load(open("data.json"))
